 *
 * Why subscription model instead of read-once-consume: React 18+ StrictMode
 * dev mode mounts components twice (mount → unmount → mount). If the
 * component consumed the store in a `useState` initializer, the second
 * mount would see an already-empty store and render null — Welcome would
 * never appear in dev. Subscribing to a stable store + tracking dismissal
 * in the store sidesteps both mounts seeing the same state.
